# Visualization Automobile Sales Statistics Dashbord

## ðŸ”‘ Scenario

Analyzed the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods, the goal is to provide insights into how the sales of Automotives, a company specializing in automotive sales, were affected during times of recession.

I will have the opportunity to demonstrate the Dashboarding skills by creating various visualizations using Plotly and Dash. As a data scientist, I have been prepared a report on your finding from Automobile Sales data analysis.

I decided to develop a dashboard representing two main reports:
  - Yearly Automobile Sales Statistics
  - Recession Period Statistics
